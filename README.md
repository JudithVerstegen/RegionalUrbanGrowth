# Regional Urban Growth

These scripts form the model and analyses for the manuscript Pattern-Oriented Calibration and Validation of Urban Growth Models: Case Studies of Dublin, Milan and Warsaw.

The file `parameters.py` contains the model settings, most importantly the case study name ('IE', 'IT', or 'PL', for the Irish, Italian, and Polish case study respectively), step size for the brute force calibration (0.1 in the manuscript) and the time periods to be used for calibration and validation.

To run the model and analyses, run the seven numbered shell scripts in order.
